# Duplicity docker with PCA support
This docker project main goal is to provide duplicity version 0.8 which support [Public Cloud Archive](https://www.ovh.com/fr/public-cloud/storage/cloud-archive/) from OVH

## Usage

For the general command-line syntax, do:
````bash
$ docker run --rm ptondereau/duplicity-pca duplicity --help
````

But usage remains the same as this repository from wernight : https://github.com/wernight/docker-duplicity
